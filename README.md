# Kokoa Chat

### Chat App

This project was created to improve my HTML and CSS skills by replicating the design of a well-known chat app. The goal was to focus on recreating the user interface, understanding layout techniques, and enhancing my design accuracy and attention to detail.

## Motivation

I started this project in preparation for my studies in Canada. As I anticipated facing challenges with English, I wanted to focus on strengthening fundamental web development skills like HTML and CSS before beginning. To achieve this, I decided to replicate a popular Korean chat app's design. Through this process, I aimed to learn how web pages are structured and how to recreate UI components similar to those used in real-world applications.

## What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how web pages are composed and how different layout techniques can be used to replicate a complex user interface. This project taught me a lot about the nuances of web design, including how to structure HTML properly and apply CSS effectively for layout and styling.
